*   **Spinach:** 3 cups fresh (about 3 oz)
*   **Onion:** ½ small, finely chopped
*   **Tomato:** 1 medium, diced
*   **Cheese:** ½ cup shredded, your favorite (cheddar, mozzarella, or a blend work well)

### Instructions:

1.  **Preheat & Prep:** Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Dice the tomato, finely chop the onion, and shred the cheese if not already shredded.
2.  **Sauté Vegetables:** Heat olive oil in an oven-safe skillet (like a cast-iron skillet) over medium heat on the stovetop. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 3-5 minutes.
3.  **Wilt Spinach:** Add the fresh spinach to the skillet with the onions. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the spinach wilts down, about 2-3 minutes.
4.  **Add Tomatoes:** Stir in the diced tomatoes and cook for another 2 minutes, just until they start to soften slightly. Remove the skillet from the heat.
5.  **Whisk Eggs:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk (if using), salt, and pepper until well combined and slightly foamy.
6.  **Assemble Bake:** Pour the whisked egg mixture evenly over the vegetables in the skillet. Sprinkle the shredded cheese over the top of the egg mixture.
7.  **Bake:** Carefully transfer the skillet to the preheated oven. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the eggs are set in the center and lightly golden brown on top.
8.  **Toast Bread:** While the egg bake is cooking, toast your bread slices.
9.  **Serve:** Remove the skillet from the oven. Let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving with the toasted bread.

### Useful Tips:

*   **Skillet Size:** A 8-inch or 9-inch oven-safe skillet works best for this recipe. If you don't have one, you can sauté the vegetables in a regular skillet and then transfer them to a greased baking dish before adding the eggs and cheese.
*   **Cheese Variation:** Feel free to experiment with different types of cheese, such as feta, goat cheese, or gruyere, for different flavor profiles.
*   **Add Spice:** For a little kick, add a pinch of red pepper flakes with the onions.
*   **Make Ahead (Partially):** You can chop the onion and dice the tomato a day in advance to save time.
*   **Storage:** Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 days. Reheat gently in the microwave or oven.
