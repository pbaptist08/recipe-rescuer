### Ingredients:

*   6 large eggs
*   1/2 cup milk (any kind)
*   1/2 medium onion, finely chopped
*   1 cup fresh spinach, roughly chopped
*   1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, halved (or 1 small tomato, diced)

*   2 slices of bread, cubed (about 1-inch pieces)
*   1 tablespoon olive oil
*   Salt and black pepper to taste

### Instructions:

1.  **Preheat Oven & Sauté Onion:** Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Heat olive oil in an oven-safe, 8-inch skillet (or a regular skillet if you'll transfer to a baking dish) over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for 3-5 minutes, until softened and translucent.
2.  **Add Spinach & Tomatoes:** Add the chopped spinach and halved tomatoes to the skillet with the onion. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, until the spinach wilts. Remove the skillet from the heat.
3.  **Prepare Egg Mixture:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
4.  **Assemble the Bake:** Scatter the cubed bread pieces evenly over the vegetables in the skillet. Pour the egg mixture over the bread and vegetables. Sprinkle the shredded cheese evenly over the top.
5.  **Bake:** Transfer the skillet (or baking dish) to the preheated oven. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the eggs are set in the center and the cheese is golden and bubbly.
6.  **Serve:** Carefully remove from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing and serving.

### Useful Tips:

*   **Skillet Choice:** If you don't have an oven-safe skillet, simply sauté the vegetables in a regular skillet and then transfer them to a small baking dish (e.g., an 8x8 inch pan) before adding the egg mixture and baking.
*   **Customization:** Feel free to add a pinch of garlic powder or dried herbs (like oregano or basil) to the egg mixture for extra flavor.
*   **Don't Overcook:** Overcooked eggs can become rubbery. The bake is done when the center is firm and bouncy to the touch.
*   **Serving Suggestions:** This egg bake is delicious on its own, or you can serve it with a side salad or a drizzle of hot sauce for an extra kick.
